	- People and their behaviors are what deliver results to your organization. (Not systems, not processes, not computers, not machines.) Results are your primary responsibility. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H9E36OG&location=445))
	- If you're going to create trust and trusting relationships with your directs, then, you're going to have to talk to them frequently about things that are important to them. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H9E36OG&location=559))

	- the most important thing you can do as a manager is to develop a trusting relationship with the people on your team. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H9E36OG&location=580))
	- Performance communication accounts for 30 percent of the total value created by engaging in the four critical behaviors. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H9E36OG&location=628))
	- The direct should do the job and not the manager, because the direct is cheaper labor. If we can achieve an acceptable quality level with less cost, for all but the most important things we do, we should do so. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H9E36OG&location=685))
	- because One On Ones are also about relationships, trust is especially important. That means that managers have to be sure to do what they say they're going to do. Thus, remembering what we've committed to do takes on special meaning. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H9E36OG&location=1166))
	- Don't make the perfect the enemy of the good. ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H9E36OG&location=1227))

	- If you're not willing to verbally joust through some turbulence when you introduce a new idea, it's probably not worth doing. ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H9E36OG&location=1240))
	- Every interruption is caused by the person being interrupted, when that person stops what she's doing. ([Location 1698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H9E36OG&location=1698))
	- Never ask a question whose answer you don't intend to honor. ([Location 3184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H9E36OG&location=3184))

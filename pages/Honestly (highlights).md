	- The way I try to share my faith is through my life. I try to let God shine through me by being nice and showing respect to people, by being an approachable and personable guy. I’m more the kind of guy that would be interested in developing a friendship with people, maybe invite them to dinner. Then, only if the door opens widely, I will talk about God. My purpose for developing the friendship is first and foremost to become someone’s friend. ([Location 1617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K60LZ8K&location=1617))

	- God does not call all people in the same way. Some He calls for service in one area and others for service in another. It’s always been frustrating for me to see Christians upset with other Christians because they believe God has the same calling for all Christians. He doesn’t.

	- Once sin creeps its way into your life, it’s hard to turn around. You can’t pull yourself back up on your own, and certainly not while you’re surrounded by people who are helping you dig the hole. This is why we all need Christ. ([Location 2284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00K60LZ8K&location=2284))

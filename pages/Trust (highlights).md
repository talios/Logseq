	- Self-trust is about having an inner voice, being connected to that inner voice, learning how to hear and follow that voice, and doing the personal healing work required to make sure that the voice you hear brings your best interests to the forefront of your mind. (Location 449)
	- Learning to trust yourself means focusing on the good you are, the good you have, and the good you desire so that the truth can heal all error thought and allow you to see the blessing hidden in all that you have been through, gone through, and grown through. (Location 628)
	- It is thinking with your higher mind, the divine gifts and fruits, that you must master. It means keeping your heart clear of the toxic emotions that often accompany negative, ego-based thinking that keeps your crown on your head. (Location 748)

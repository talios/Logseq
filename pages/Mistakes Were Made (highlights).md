- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Mar 25th, 2025]]
	- We are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue, and then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ERAQN64&location=122))
	- Most people, when directly confronted with proof that they are wrong, do not change their point of view or course of action but justify it even more tenaciously. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ERAQN64&location=144))
	- Self-justification not only minimizes our mistakes and bad decisions; it is also the reason that everyone can see a hypocrite in action except the hypocrite. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ERAQN64&location=180))
	- Parent blaming is a popular and convenient form of self-justification because it allows people to live less uncomfortably with their regrets and imperfections. ([Location 1281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ERAQN64&location=1281))
	- we construct entire narratives on the basis of memories that are often right but also often dead wrong. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ERAQN64&location=1368))
	- False memories allow us to forgive ourselves and justify our mistakes, but sometimes at a high price: an inability to take responsibility for our lives. ([Location 1552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ERAQN64&location=1552))
	- The scientific method consists of the use of procedures designed to show not that our predictions and hypotheses are right, but that they might be wrong. ([Location 1779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ERAQN64&location=1779))
		- **Note**: I wonder if this could be applied to static typing and "incorrect" programs.
	- Anger reflects the hope that a problem can be corrected. When it burns out, it leaves the ashes of resentment and contempt. And contempt is the handmaiden of hopelessness. ([Location 2794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ERAQN64&location=2794))
		- **Note**: Todays deep thought moment...
	- ‘An error does not become a mistake until you refuse to correct it.’ ([Location 3494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ERAQN64&location=3494))
	- A great nation is like a great man: When he makes a mistake, he realizes it. Having realized it, he admits it. Having admitted it, he corrects it. He considers those who point out his faults as his most benevolent teachers. ([Location 3779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ERAQN64&location=3779))

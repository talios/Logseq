	- However, these false claims will keep spreading unless somehow kept in check. I cannot any longer accept that it’s better to keep quiet and not rock the boat. (Location 138)
		- **Note**: I hate being a yes man, but also hate being "the argumentative one".
	- “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.” (Location 321)
	- Research matters. We’re less likely to shoot ourselves in the foot when we base our decisions on solid evidence, and much more when we follow whim, fashion or whoever spoke last or the loudest. (Location 353)
	- when I researched the issue: the 10x claim is poorly supported by empirical evidence; that is, essentially anecdotal. It persists largely because we lack any well-articulated theory of what productivity consists of for a programmer. (Location 417)
	- Dickey pointed out that the 28:1 ratio was observed because “subject 7 required 170 hours to program the ‘algebra’ program in a batch environment, in machine language (while) subject 3 required 6 hours to program the same problem in JTS (ALGOL) in a time-shared environment.” (Location 467)
	- The “Chief Programmer Team” was a technique invented by Mills and extensively used at NASA - it involved a “superprogrammer” bossing around a group of lesser individuals, much as surgical teams are organized around a chief surgeon. (Location 600)

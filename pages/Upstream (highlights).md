	- When you spend years responding to problems, you can sometimes overlook the fact that you could be preventing them. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=272))

	- Downstream actions react to problems once they’ve occurred. Upstream efforts aim to prevent those problems from happening. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=291))

	- That’s one reason why we tend to favor reaction: Because it’s more tangible. Downstream work is easier to see. Easier to measure. There is a maddening ambiguity about upstream efforts. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=325))

	- A telltale sign of upstream work is that it involves systems thinking: ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=336))

	- “To solve the aggression problems, which are mainly a male problem, we need to focus on females,” Tremblay told Nature.10 “If you ameliorate the quality of life of women, it will transfer to the next generation.” ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=364))

		- **Note**: This Is all fine until my brain considers a sci-fi time travel scenario where improving the would be mothers life, may bring about the prevention of a childs birth. Then we get all conflicted.
	- we will always want someone there to rescue us. The point is that our attention is grossly asymmetrical. We’re so focused on saving the drowning kids in the river that we fail to investigate why they need saving at all. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=385))
	- The last human being to be naturally infected with smallpox was a hospital cook named Ali Maow Maalin in Merca, Somalia. After he was found to be infected in 1977, a frantic two-week effort led to the vaccination of 54,777 people in the surrounding community, just to make sure the disease couldn’t spread further.33 fn2 And that was the end of smallpox. We didn’t treat it; we vanquished it. That’s upstream work at its best. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=469))
	- if you wait for the bad things to happen, you can never quite put things back together the way they were before.” ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=522))
	- Pro athletes play hard. Injuries are gonna happen. You can’t change that. That mind-set is an example of what I’ll call “problem blindness”—the belief that negative outcomes are natural or inevitable. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=524))
	- “It’s so obvious that if you get through school, you will get through school.” ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=607))
	- To succeed upstream, leaders must: detect problems early, target leverage points in complex systems, find reliable ways to measure success, pioneer new ways of working together, and embed their successes into systems to give them permanence. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=621))
	- “inattentional blindness,” a phenomenon in which our careful attention to one task leads us to miss important information that’s unrelated to that task. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=632))
	- habituation is frequently used as a therapy for people’s phobias. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=645))
	- What Lin was doing, with the term sexual harassment, was the opposite: She wanted to problematize the normal. To reclassify the coercive treatment of women as something abnormal—to attach a stigma to it. She helped society awaken from problem blindness by giving the problem a name. ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=668))
	- The escape from problem blindness begins with the shock of awareness that you’ve come to treat the abnormal as normal. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=763))
	- This lack of ownership is the second force that keeps us downstream. The first force, problem blindness, means: I don’t see the problem. (Or, This problem is inevitable.) A lack of ownership, though, means that the parties who are capable of addressing a problem are saying, That’s not mine to fix. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=823))
	- the question is not: Who suffers most from the problem? The question is: Who’s best positioned to fix it, and will they step up? ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=830))
	- “what often prevents people from protesting is not a lack of motivation to protest, but rather their feeling that they lack the legitimacy to do so.” ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=839))
	- I choose to fix this problem, not because it’s demanded of me, but because I can, and because it’s worth fixing. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=1033))
	- When people are juggling a lot of problems, they give up trying to solve them all.3 They adopt tunnel vision. There’s no long-term planning; there’s no strategic prioritization of issues. And that’s why tunneling is the third barrier to upstream thinking—because it confines us to short-term, reactive thinking. In the tunnel, there’s only forward. ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=1069))
	- If you can’t systematically solve problems, it dooms you to stay in an endless cycle of reaction. Tunneling begets more tunneling. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=1113))
	- The need for heroism is usually evidence of systems failure. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=1120))
	- How do you escape the tunnel? You need slack. Slack, in this context, means a reserve of time or resources that can be spent on problem solving. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=1120))
	- The path to “the world avoided” is a difficult one because of the barriers we’ve seen: problem blindness (I don’t see the problem), lack of ownership (That problem is not mine to fix), and tunneling (I can’t deal with that right now). ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=1243))
	- “Data takes you away from philosophical insights. You move away from anecdotal fights about what people think is happening to what is happening,” she said. “You can’t solve a dynamic problem with static data.”86 ([Location 1584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=1584))
	- “You’re not helpless. You have an enormous amount of individual power and collective power …. Meaningful participation in democratic processes allows you to express agency, and agency is good for your health.” ([Location 1810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=1810))
	- The postmortem for a problem can be the preamble to a solution. ([Location 1997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=1997))
	- The reason to house the homeless or prevent disease or feed the hungry is not because of the financial returns but because of the moral returns. ([Location 2050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2050))
	- Nothing is easy. The world is complex and there are no quick fixes. But if I can learn to uncross my arms and extend my hands, I can be someone who eases suffering rather than ignores it. ([Location 2117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2117))
	- when we allow ourselves to be shielded and disconnected from those who are vulnerable and disfavored, ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2129))
	- When everything is cause for alarm, nothing is cause for alarm. ([Location 2297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2297))
	- People aren’t “gaming metrics,” they’re defiling the mission. ([Location 2512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2512))
	- When people are rewarded for achieving a certain number, or punished for missing it, they will cheat. They will skew. They will skim. They will downgrade. In the mindless pursuit of “hitting the numbers,” ([Location 2569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2569))
		- **Note**: Devops - we must deploy 100 times a day/week ord we're not being productive!
	- When we try to prevent future problems, there’s always a risk that we’ll fail. But beyond that, there’s a risk that our efforts to do good might actually cause harm instead. ([Location 2617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2617))
	- “As you think about a system, spend part of your time from a vantage point that lets you see the whole system, not just the problem that may have drawn you to focus on the system to begin with,” ([Location 2671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2671))
	- We succeed by ensuring that we’ll have the feedback we need to navigate. ([Location 2765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2765))
	- “Systems can’t be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned. ([Location 2878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2878))
	- Who Will Pay for What Does ([Location 2882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VMVZ9MN&location=2882))

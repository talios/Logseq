- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Mar 25th, 2025]]
	- For too long the battle for social justice has been waged by middle-class hipsters, the kind who shop at Urban Outfitters and think that beard oil is a sensible investment. ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=86))
		- **Note**: I may not be a hipster - but I take offence that beard oil is not regarded as a sensible investment, unless you're stockpiling. I prefer smoothness than brittle edges.
	- I teabag the foes of justice with a gender-neutral scrotum. I suckle the babes of hope with my sinewy teats of equality. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=97))
	- Before I was even out of the crib I was self-harming with my nappy pin. By the age of four, I was suffering from both anorexia and chronic overeating. When these two conditions occur simultaneously it can be difficult to spot, because the victim ends up eating a regular amount of food on a consistent basis. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=112))
	- As Professor Rochelle Gutiérrez from the University of Illinois has pointed out, ‘on many levels, mathematics itself operates as Whiteness’. Indeed, the Ku Klux Klan were once known to set fire to plus signs in order to intimidate their victims. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=124))
	- Women in power rarely make mistakes. Margaret Thatcher does not count, because she was a woman only in a strictly biological sense. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=197))
	- If all children were obese, then no one would ever be bullied for being fat. So if you are serious about combatting fat-shaming, you have a responsibility to overfeed your kids. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=225))
	- Sixty-two per cent of adults in the UK are classified as overweight or obese; how is it possible that a team that claims to represent the nation does not include one single person of girth (POG)? This kind of discrimination is precisely why the fat acceptance movement is so essential. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=235))

		- **Note**: Person of Girth - dat me!
	- Slice your throat with the frozen piss of Christ. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=293))
	- ‘Are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun,’ she asked, ‘thus logically being only fit to live underground like grovelling goblins?’ For all the conservative establishment’s talk of thin-skinned ‘snowflakes’, I find the real snowflakes, like their namesakes, tend to be white. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=337))
	- I would rather be boiled alive in a giant crucible of yak’s piss than have a man look at me without my consent. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=531))
	- He-Man was at least progressive enough to announce his pronouns. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=564))
	- Find a plant and fuck it. It’s not so much a choice as a duty. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=630))
	- There is nothing particularly male about having a huge beard, broad shoulders and a massive cock. My friend Belinda is hung like a shire stallion. That doesn’t make her any less feminine. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=962))
	- Let’s not forget that Al-Qaeda started off as an improvisational sketch group. ([Location 1308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ML46LQ4&location=1308))
	- It has been an enjoyable experience sharing these thoughts, penning a kind of bible for my woke disciples. But I will not rest until we have achieved our diverse intersectional socialist decolonised polyamorous genderqueer pro-trans body-positive anti-ableist privilege-checking speech-policing hate-free matriarchal utopia.

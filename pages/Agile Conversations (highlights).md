	- Employees’ frustration and despair at their inability to change things exist at all levels and in almost all organizations we’ve worked with—and we feel empathy, because we get stuck in this pattern ourselves. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YZP8LC9&location=181))
	- We also become more aware that we don’t have telepathy—that we don’t actually know what information our conversational partners have—so we get better at asking questions and listening to the answers. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YZP8LC9&location=192))
	- “fundamental shift in how people had to think about how they interact, how they collaborate and work, and if you don’t spend time changing people’s behaviors, you don’t spend time changing culture and how people make decisions, all of this falls flat.” ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YZP8LC9&location=318))

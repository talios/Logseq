	- Since I hacked my governor module, it’s not like I haven’t thought about killing the humans. But once I started exploring the company servers and found hundreds of hours of downloadable entertainment media, I just thought, there’s no hurry. I can always kill the humans later, after the next series drops. ([Location 9](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CD39L16K&location=9))
		- **Note**: Now thats a great way to open...
	- (Imaginary humans on the entertainment feed are much nicer than real humans.) ([Location 26](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CD39L16K&location=26))
	- Since I hacked my governor module, I sometimes do things and I’m not sure entirely why. (Apparently suddenly getting free will after having 93% of your behavior controlled for your entire existence will do weird things to your impulse control.) ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CD39L16K&location=44))
	- I initiated a secure link between my armor and her suit, and said, “We have forty-five seconds to get out of here before we both die.” ([Location 54](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CD39L16K&location=54))
	- Sekai and the others would be hit with fines for almost clogging the collectors with her burning body, but it was better than being dead. I guess. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CD39L16K&location=65))
	- Note to self: shut up. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CD39L16K&location=69))

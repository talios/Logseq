	- Functional programming languages approach code reuse differently from object-oriented languages. Object-oriented languages tend to have many data structures with many operations, whereas functional languages exhibit few data structures with many operations.

	- The other feature that functional programs tend toward is referential transparency: the calling routine shouldn’t care whether it accesses a value or a function that returns a value. If a function can also throw an exception, it isn’t a safe substitute for a value. ([Location 4373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LEX6SP8&location=4373))

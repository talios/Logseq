	- The Cannonball Run, from 1981, was a movie about a group of people racing their cars across the USA, that included a line from Burt Reynolds that stuck with me: "What's behind me is not important". Genuinely great advice. Don't get hung up on the past; you can't change it. Don't get hung up on the future; you can't control that either (although you can, and should, attempt to influence it).

	- Sons of light must not have fellowship with deeds, doctrines, or deceits of darkness. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00295H06Q&location=464))
	- all the cloudiness and gloom of your soul cannot conceal your light from His gracious eye. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00295H06Q&location=482))
	- The iniquities of our public worship, its hypocrisy, formality, lukewarmness, irreverence, wandering of heart, and forgetfulness of God—what a full measure have we there! Our work for the Lord, its emulation, selfishness, carelessness, slackness, unbelief—what a mass of defilement is there! Our private devotions, their laxity, coldness, neglect, sleepiness, and vanity—what a mountain of dead earth is there! ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00295H06Q&location=562))
	- Those who serve God with a sad countenance, because they do what is unpleasant to them, are not serving Him at all; they bring the form of loyalty, but the life is absent. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00295H06Q&location=614))
	- That obedience that is not voluntary is disobedience, for the Lord looks at the heart, and if He sees that we serve Him from force, and not because we love Him, He will reject our offering. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00295H06Q&location=617))
	- The Christian disgraces his profession more often in prosperity than in adversity. It is a dangerous thing to be prosperous. The crucible of adversity is a less severe trial for the Christian than the place of prosperity. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00295H06Q&location=1791))

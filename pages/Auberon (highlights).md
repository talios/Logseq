	- Because it was developed, it was influential. Because it was influential, it was wealthy. And because it was wealthy, it was corrupt. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YXRLQNK&location=69))
	- Overdoing is also falling short. Better to have a good night end well than push for perfect and undo what had been achieved. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YXRLQNK&location=226))
	- “So anyway, there was this thing way back when. They used to have these huge recreational drug companies. Totally illegal. And when someone new would come into town or get elected or whatever, the question was: silver or lead? Plata o plomo. Does the new sheriff in town take a bribe or a bullet? Hell of a slogan. It’s simple, you know? Boils everything down. You have to admire that.” ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YXRLQNK&location=247))
	- “There was a guy I knew back in Sol system used to say that money was like sex. You thought it would fix everything until you got a lot of it. Because that’s what we all reach for. Anything we need, anything we want, anything that’s grinding us down, we can get high or rich or laid and make it better. Only if that was true, people would eventually get enough drugs or money or sex and be happy.” ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YXRLQNK&location=760))
	- “You’re young yet. I’m not. There’s this thing when you get older where you have to make a choice. Everyone does. You have to decide whether you care more about being your best self or your real one. If you’re more loyal to who you ought to be or who you really are. You know what I’m talking about?” ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YXRLQNK&location=884))
	- It’s the basic problem with religion, be it Jesus or Vishnu or God Emperors. Ideological purity never survives contact with the enemy.” ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YXRLQNK&location=903))

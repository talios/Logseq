		- **Note**: It boggles the mind that somewhere, at some point in time, that someone had possible thought not being trustworthy might have been a good thing. To actively pursue the breaking of someone's trust, and thus becoming untrustworthy - just seems so illogical.
	- The resulting pain and anxiety make us wonder if we’ll ever want to trust again. ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008ML4STI&location=106))

	- If you were frequently shamed, deliberately betrayed, or suffered significant loss in childhood, an inability to trust your feelings and perceptions may linger into adulthood. This can cause simple misunderstandings to trigger self-doubt and limit your ability to be open in your most important relationships. Changing beliefs about your worth is essential to developing high levels of self-trust. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008ML4STI&location=270))

	- Faith in a positive future means a willingness to go forward, despite the risk of failure or loss. Faith in the face of uncertainty is based on a sense that there is something intrinsically good about life, people in general, and your own future. It is not dependent on a single situation, person, or belief. Faith appears when you offer your heart to the truth, opening to a kinder reality, even after terrible things have happened. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008ML4STI&location=297))

	- As you grow, the Protector develops new ways to keep you safe, denying pain and minimizing your feelings. Other techniques to numb bad feelings are added as you become more independent. Overeating, drugs, and forbidden relationships give a sense of immediate relief, regardless of the eventual negative consequences.

	- The Adult holds the courage to act in spite of feeling anxious or uncertain. This is the face you present to the world. The Adult plans and sets goals, reads self-help books, goes to work, talks thoughtfully with friends, and pays the bills. This is the socialized self who looks for meaning in life and strives to not take things too personally. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008ML4STI&location=494))

	- Should you not feel safe enough to ask, or there is no response, you are left with reviewing what happened alone. You are likely to find yourself teetering between being angry and wondering what you did wrong. Thoughts and feelings come fast and contradict each other. There is a danger of overreacting. This is because your three selves are out of balance, and the Adult is no longer in charge. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008ML4STI&location=533))

	- When your trust is betrayed, such as when a painful secret is told or you are deceived, someone can suddenly shift from intimate or friend to being completely outside the circle. This is devastating. What happens next depends on the mutual willingness to rebuild trust or decide to disconnect.

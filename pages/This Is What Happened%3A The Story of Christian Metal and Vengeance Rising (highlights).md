- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Jul 28th, 2025]]
	- New fads like the prosperity doctrine were quickly shot down in flames
	- We became critical thinkers instead of sheep that followed the latest theological nonsense
	- What I remember most of all is an audience participation thing called the “Mosh Pit”
	- “Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.” 1 Timothy 2:15
	- Back in the day, glam rock involved long teased hair, spandex material, and makeup. But was not considered homosexual or transexual. Maybe by a few outsiders but in no way by the fans. It was always presented with a macho swagger with musicians having a hot babe on each arm. Nobody was stupid and confused. You either had a hole or a pole. No brainer.

- Highlights first synced by [[Readwise]] [[Mar 25th, 2025]]
	- Your gifter is someone who saw this book, knows your brain, and thought “this software will run great on that hardware (Location 150)
	- The Kid takes a long, sorrowful chug from a whiskey bottle usually reserved for sprint planning (Location 180)
	- you should try to apply the word “fuck” to your point of view about more things in your life. (Location 204)
		- **Note**: Fuuuuuccccck
	- if you’re an app-tier person, understanding the front end or the database will probably yield more benefits for both you and the project than learning more obscure Python, C#, or Java functions or patterns that let you do what you’re already doing with a few less lines of code. (Location 272)
	- But other than for comedy purposes, the last thing the world needs is anyone using a programming language as a means of self-expression that tests the boundaries of imagination and inscrutability (Location 286)
	- If I get a codebase to maintain that looks like three hours of amphetamine-fueled Thelonious Monk “Round Midnight” explorations, I’m not likely to respond with “cool”. (Location 287)
	- it takes a lot of knowledge to be qualified to accurately judge your own incompetence. (Location 299)
	- it’s hard for me to say for certain based on our limited interactions. But I can absolutely fucking promise you that you do not suck. I know this can be hard if you’re not wired this way but do your best to get past this way of thinking. It inhibits you, and life is too fucking short (Location 303)
	- At that moment, my body, not my brain or my mouth, said the word “fuck”. This has only happened to me a couple of times but imagine the word “fuck” was a two-foot-long centipede that was able to crawl up your spine through the hole in the middle of each vertebrae. It takes its time, and you feel it click past each bone. “Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck”, said my body. (Location 390)
	- I’m not suggesting we port the jiu jitsu model over to our professional lives and start to choke each other unconscious with our knowledge of Infrastructure as Code scripting (Location 467)
		- **Note**: ...but what if...?
	- Decide and own. At some point, whether the team goes forward with the silverback or the rookie, it’s time to end all debate and invest yourselves in the chosen path. Once a decision is made and the direction is chosen, even the die-hard skeptics need to get on board and support a positive outcome any way they can. (Location 500)
	- happiness was having a great close people network as you age. This isn’t four thousand anonymous connections on fucking LinkedIn, this is about the people that care about you, who you care about back. (Location 510)
	- Long-term happiness isn’t correlated with wealth, position, or other traditional success metrics. It’s about your people. (Location 513)
	- I don’t give a shit what you use but keep my entire rationale in mind. It’s worth adding that the absolute last thing a manager-of-managers wants to experience ever in their lifetime is even one whole minute of some dipshit dragging around a quilt-sized open-world free-form diagram while trying to explain a project while all anyone else can see are what appears to be serial-killer prison-wall scribblings. (Location 685)
	- A leader should do nothing if everyone else has it covered. If shit is moving ahead, the machine is humming along, the leader should shut the fuck up and let good be good. (Location 763)

	- If you need a pretty good Python programmer, and they’re not a pretty good Python programmer, then you don’t give a fuck whether or not they’re also Batman. (Location 926)
	- If you start with 20 roles open, hire 10 people, and still think you should have the original 10 roles open, you’re not doing it right. (Location 972)
	- But as that leader, you… and here’s a volleyball reference to sustain the metaphor incoherence… do not spike the ball, you set up your people to spike the ball. (Location 1020)
	- If your work doesn’t have a UI, make two slides of something relevant to what you did. It could be screenshots of code, some DDL, a diagram, a gif of a process working in a command shell, statistics of what improved before and after your changes, it doesn’t matter, it just has to be something. It does not need to be clean and fancy, don’t waste time on pretty slides, just put some shit on a screen to show your team. Trust me, this is good. (Location 1312)
	- Tip: add an alcoholism OKR, because regardless of how the year goes, you’ll hit that one. Cheers! (Location 1488)
	- You’ll be fine, but get some fucking help. (Location 1603)

	- To throw down the challenge gauntlet, if you think of yourself as senior, but you tolerate a slow dev environment, or an onerous code-run-test loop, or a too-many-steps house-of-cards deployment process, to name a few of the many components that are as, or more, important than whatever you’re being asked to build, then you, my friend, are not. (Location 2148)
	- always create your new magic integrated with the existing codebase and never demo to anyone off of localhost. (Location 2181)
	- anyone who believes COUNT(*) is less efficient than COUNT(1) or any other option, is wrong. Anyone who believes this and says it out loud to correct other people is an ass. (Location 2680)
	- I will never again let a business I’m involved with get too dependent on a single client (Location 3144)
	- Tip: if you’re making slides for someone else, be sure to include one that just says [demo]. (Location 3270)

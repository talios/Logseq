	- I learned to listen for feelings, to express my needs, to accept answers that I didn’t always want to hear. He is not here to make me happy, nor am I here to create happiness for him. We have both learned to grow, to accept, and to love, so that we can each be fulfilled. (Location 468)
	- Often in the past, when I knew that a patient had a fatal disease, I myself would get caught in the prognosis, and it was hard for me to sincerely encourage them to live their lives. (Location 488)
		- **Note**: Somewhat topical....
	- Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and values. (Location 578)
	- the mismatch of our ever-changing world and our relatively static language forms is part of our problem.” (Location 731)
	- inferring what another person is thinking is not the same as observing his behavior. (Location 778)
	- People are disturbed not by things, but by the view they take of them. —Epictetus (Location 1182)
	- Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs. (Location 1245)
	- “It sounds like you’re scared we might miss our plane, and disgusted because you’d like a faster train running between these terminals.” (Location 1599)
		- **Note**: Responses like this sound rather condescending to me - they sojnd like you're mocking the other person.
	- The clearer we are about what we want, the more likely it is that we’ll get it. (Location 1612)
	- suffice. At other times, we need more than “Yes, I understood you,” to feel confident that we’ve been truly understood. (Location 1617)
		- **Note**: What about when they think they've understood you, so they say "yes"  but their interpretation/understanding differs - you're still at a loss.
	- To make sure the message we sent is the message that’s received, ask the listener to reflect it back. (Location 1620)
	- The more we interpret noncompliance as rejection, the more likely our requests will be heard as demands. (Location 1713)
	- “The hearing that is only in the ears is one thing. The hearing of the understanding is another. But the hearing of the spirit is not limited to any one faculty, to the ear, or to the mind. (Location 1888)
	- Believing we have to “fix” situations and make others feel better prevents us from being present. (Location 1921)
	- “‘What will they think of me?’ must be put aside for bliss.” (Location 2032)

	- Shame is a form of self-hatred, and actions taken in reaction to shame are not free and joyful acts. (Location 2501)
	- The parties also need to know from the start that the objective is not to get the other side to do what they want them to do. (Location 3017)
	- analyses that imply wrongness are essentially tragic expressions of unmet needs. (Location 3097)
	- I once worked with a company where both morale and productivity took a dive due to a very disturbing conflict. Two factions in the same department were fighting over which software to use, generating strong emotions on both sides. One faction had worked especially hard to develop the software that was presently in use, and wanted to see its continued use. The other faction had strong emotions tied up in creating new software. I started by asking each side to tell me what needs of theirs would be better fulfilled by the software they advocated. Their response was to offer an intellectual analysis that the other side received as criticism. A member on the side that favored new software said: “We can continue to be overly conservative, but if we do that, I think we could be out of work in the future. Progress means that we take some risks, and dare to show that we are beyond old-fashioned ways of doing things.” A member of the opposing faction responded, “But I think that impulsively grabbing for every new thing that comes along is not in our best interest.” They acknowledged that they had been repeating these same analyses for months and were getting nowhere other than increasing tension for themselves.

		- **Note**: Sounds extremely familiar.....
	- Punitive action, on the other hand, is based on the assumption that people commit offenses because they are bad or evil, and to correct the situation, they need to be made to repent. Their “correction” is undertaken through punitive action designed to make them (1) suffer enough to see the error of their ways, (2) repent, and (3) change. In practice, however, punitive action, rather than evoking repentance and learning, is just as likely to generate resentment and hostility and to reinforce resistance to the very behavior we are seeking. (Location 3407)
	- Fear of corporal punishment obscures children’s awareness of the compassion underlying their parents’ demands. (Location 3421)
	- Compliments are often judgments—however positive-of others. (Location 3759)

	- a hack is someone who is writing so freely and unselfconsciously that the material is flowing from some deep inner fountain, a place where true beliefs and feelings dwell.

	- In journalism, reporters are taught to get to the four W’s right away: who, what, when, where. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003H4QZOG&location=282))

	- Thou must not alienate, infuriate or otherwise piss off the reviewers. I know, it's not fair. They can write whatever they want about your book and you aren't allowed to respond. It sucks -- but who ever said that life is fair? A review is just one person's opinion, even if it is printed in the New York Times. It's not worth getting in a pissing match over. Authors never win pissing matches with critics. ([Location 2157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003H4QZOG&location=2157))

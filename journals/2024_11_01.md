- Installed nightly fish, now rust based - let see this machine burn!
	- Install didn't give errors, just didn't give me a binary either :( Uninstalled and back to stable.
- **SMX**
	- Merged Secret based `Password` changes, where closer to SMX in K8S
	- Merged Jonathans whitelist changes, released API and Jackson based updates, need the core merge tho.

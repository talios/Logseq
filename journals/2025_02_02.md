- Seems I pissed off Andy when I returned from the Papercity gig around 1:30am, whilst I turned off the car engine quickly, I was watching the rest of a bit of TV in the car briefly, which was possibly a bit too loud - woke him up, shockingly he actually engaged with me, rather abusively actually. Apparently, I'm an inconsiderate idiot who only for himself. It was about a minute, altho apparently I'm ALWAYS doing it - which is odd as it's the first I've been got home at 1:30 in months.
	- ...of course, he may just be referring also to listening to YouTube/TikTok on phone at midnight when I head to bed.  Or watching TV _in the lounge

	- CT scan all clear
	- No rush on Gastroscopy as they no longer use that as a test for issues with bleeding, if you're on the medication. Ironically, as I was leaving the hospital, I received a phone call from said hospital offering me a Gastroscopy appointment for 30 July at 8 am. May as well take it.

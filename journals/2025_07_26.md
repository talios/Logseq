- Picked up a sink strainger plug from Bunnings - hopefully it fits, altho it was only $10 so no big deal....and.... nope - muggins here didn't actually look at the sink did he - I guess I need to unscrew/remove the existing stopper, but I'm not even sure how I install/use this :)
- Finished binging Seasons 1 and 2 of Poker Face - so good.
- A great [[Jujutsu]] reference config that I'm steeling ideas from: https://github.com/thoughtpolice/a/blob/canon/tilde/aseipp/dotfiles/jj/config.toml

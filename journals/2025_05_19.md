- Viture Pro glasses arrived - sadly seems they require USB-C Display Port, which the Hiby DAPs I have don't support so will have to wait til the HDMI adapter arrives to even try these out. They didn't seem to work on the macmini either, which MAY have been use to already running a USB-C monitor tho....

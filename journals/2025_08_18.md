- SMX3
	- DR Manager - Partial evisceration
	- Helping Colin with Gerrit
		- -1'd new review
	- Helping Jon with SEG API info
	- Message Remediation
		- Talked with Wayne a bit about setup
	- Jonathan H fixed QSR staging, so we should be able to test the changes once code reviews are done.
	- Cedrec identified an issue with the Customer Activity report after I questioned the test plan (I wasn't specific enough), and it revealed a small typo introduced when fixing a broken `&mdash` without a `;` â€“ it has been fixed, attemmpted to deploy to AUS but got:
	  ```
	  Error response from daemon: rpc error: 
	    code = Unknown desc = The swarm does not have a leader.
	    It's possible that too few managers are online.
	    Make sure more than half of the managers are online.

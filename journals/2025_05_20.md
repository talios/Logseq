- Pricing [[Meeting]]
	- Tentative Live 1st July, I doubt it tho. Not with XMS/Spark in the way.
	- Look at scripting support for just bulk updating direct agreements, based on data from the billing export report, with a new column added for updated price.
		- Could be something for Jonathan to look at? It should be relatively simple if using the integration test client. I wonder if I should push that #git subrepo back to its original and release it.

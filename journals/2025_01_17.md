- **14:32** All day and it's only just NOW taking me to resolve what eventuated to just being a `ROLLBACK PREPARED 'xxx'` transaction, from TWO years! [[SMX3]] dev/staging seemingly works again (although some secrets need to be configured in dev).
- **16:40** Well that a took a while of commit trawling.

  Back in 2021, we fixed the DB ownership of tables, which changes the *original* hardcoded `smx` user in the existing migrations, and bootstrap to be configurable.
  In 2023 we added a migration for the account blacklists, whereas previously it had just been live hacked into XM1 as a hack fix, this migration doesn't set an OWNER - ewps.
  
  No more `CREATE TABLE` migrations in the flyway migrations that affect AU* til Jonathans late last year, which DOES set the owner, only - the containers were still configured with `smx` as the owner. That user no longer AFAIK exists (possibly when we switched to the Flexible PostgreSQL instances). And since we've not deployed to AU* for most of last year whilst we were all hella busy with Farmville, no new image was deployed to AUS this morning, followed immediately by many tears on my part.

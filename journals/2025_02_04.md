- Appointment with Dr Mayer - the renal doctor about my Stones. $480 for an hour consultation/discussion, he's sent me for another blood test and scheduled another 24-hour urine test for the week prior we see each other again at the end of March. I'm to change my diet to drop the salt levels to test a few things before he prescribes some medication to help with the calcium levels. #health

- [Reorient GitHub Pull Requests Around Changesets â€“ Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/writing/github-changesets) - an old post that resurfaced.  It sums up my issues with Github PRs quite well, sad to see things haven't really improved much.
- Another interesting week of [[music]] - new Will Smith is.... well it exists. New Ghost and Katatonia singles, new Cytotoxin and Epica rips, Bright Ophidia and The Man-Eating Tree so good, Bjorn Riis is back with a solo masterpiece, Soliloquium dooms hard.

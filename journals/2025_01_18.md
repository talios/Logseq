- **16:16** I picked up a VESA mount to set up the 2nd monitor that I got to take to Napier at Christmas, have just screw-mounted it to the desk and mounted the 2nd monitor vertically - almost wish I'd got a higher resolution screen, but for $200 it works fine - and a perfect spot to keep slack etc. off the side. ![IMG_2915.jpg](../assets/IMG_2915_1737170484841_0.jpg){:height 593, :width 780}

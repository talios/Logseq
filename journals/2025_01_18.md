- 16:16 I picked up a VESA mount to set up the 2nd monitor that I got to take to Napier at Christmas, have just screw mounted it to the desk and mounted the 2nd monitor vertically - almost wish I'd got a higher resolution screen, but for $200 it works fine - and a perfect spot to keep slack etc. off the the side.

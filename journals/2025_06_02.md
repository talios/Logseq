- Nicholas the Barber
	- Holy fuck. He stepped away for one second, and I didn't have my glasses on so couldn't quite see what he picked up - nek minute my nose is stuffed with hot wax….
	- …no more calm breathing, so I’m back to being a mouth breather as he’s trimming around everywhere - worse breathing than when I had my last MRI!
	  Surprisingly, when he finally yanked them, there was no pain, but good lord, what came out!

- Spent chunks of the long weekend working on a [[SMX3]] price patching script/tool. Works well, using Unirest, OpenCSV.

- Nicholas the Barber
	- Holy fuck. He stepped away for one second and I didn't have my glasses on so couldn't quite see what he picked up - nek minute my nose is stuffed with hot wax….
	- …no more calm breathing so i’m back to being a mouth breather as he’s trimming around everywhere - worse breathing than when I had my last MRI!
	  When he finally yanked them - surprising no pain, but good lord what came out!
